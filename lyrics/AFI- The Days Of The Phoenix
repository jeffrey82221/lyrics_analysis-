I remember when
I was told of story of crushed velvet, candle wax and dried up flowers
The figure on the bed
All dressed up in roses, calling, beckoning to sleep, offering a dream

Words were as mystical as purring animals
The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
The time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below

No one could see me

(Oh!)
I fell into yesterday
(Oh!)
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
(Oh!)
I fell into fantasy

Words were as mystical as purring animals
The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
The time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below

No one could see me

(Oh!)
I fell into yesterday
(Oh!)
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
(Oh!)
I fell into fantasy

The girl on the wall always waited for me
And she was always smiling
The teenage death boys, the teenage death girls
And everyone was dancing

Nothing could touch us then, no one could change us then
Everyone was dancing
Nothing could hurt us then, no one could see us then
Everyone was dancing

No one could see me

(Oh!)
I fell into yesterday
(Oh!)
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
(Oh!)
I fell into fantasy

Our dreams seemed not far away
I fell into fantasy
