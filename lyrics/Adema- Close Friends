Today you told me that I'd hate you forever
I can't believe what's really going on
Somehow I knew that you felt guilty for something
But tell me why you'd do this to me

Today you told me that I'd hate you forever
I can't believe that you wrecked my life

I was betrayed
How can you say
That you feel sorry inside
It's devastating
Losing close friends
I've gone away
You make me stay
But I can't deal with the lies
I've gone insane
Losing close friends

Today I made the worst mistake
I put my trust into someone I don't know
And now I know because you've done everything impossible to me
Made me so upset
And now I know just who to trust
Because you're laying in bed
You're thinking about all that fucked up shit

I was betrayed
How can you say
That you feel sorry inside
It's devastating
Losing close friends
I've gone away
You make me stay
But I can't deal with the lies
I've gone insane
Losing close friends

I'm so weak
The closeness of your skin
The smell of this place
Makes me go insane
You make me go insane

I was betrayed
How can you say
That you feel sorry inside
It's devastating
Losing close friends
I've gone away
You make me stay
But I can't deal with the lies
I've gone insane
Losing close friends
