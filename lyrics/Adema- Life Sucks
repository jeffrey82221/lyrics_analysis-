Try and put me down 
You can't comprehend 
In the places 
In The Life that Ive Been 
Hold your tounge some how 
Lie And put me down 
With all of My life givin' 

HMMMM 
HMMMM 
HMMMM 
HMMMM 

Look at me this once 
Don't you turn your head 
While you tell 
Me you Love Him 
Don't you cry again 
When you see the past 
I've Just left 
And spit in your face 

HMMMM 
HMMMM 
HMMMM 
HMMMM 

Everyone thinks 
Lieeee too yourself 
And then make believe 

WHYYYYYYYYYYY 
I gave myself 
To live with to face to 
DIEEEEEEEEEEEE 
What i was possed to 
And look into your 
EYEEEEEEEEEEEE 
Waitin' to touch you 
And make everything all 
RIGHTTTTTTTTT 
I'm so lonely 
WAITTTTTTTTT!!!! 

LOOK!!! at me 
This once 
DON'T!!! you turn your head 
While you tell me you love him 
DON'T!!! you cry again 
WHEN!!! you see the past 
I've just left 
And spit in your face 

DONT TURN YOUR HEAD 3x 
DON'T DENY IT!!! 
DON'T DENY IT!!!
