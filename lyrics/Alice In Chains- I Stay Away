Yeah, hey I
Want to travel south this year
I whoa
Won't prevent safe passage here

Why you act crazy, not an act maybe
So close a lady, shifty eyes shady

Yeah, hey yeah
Tears that soak a callous heart

Why you act frightened, I am enlightened
Your weakness builds me, so someday you'll see

I stay away!

Why you act crazy, not an act maybe
So close a lady, shifty eyes shady

I stay away!
I stay away!
I stay away!
I stay away!
