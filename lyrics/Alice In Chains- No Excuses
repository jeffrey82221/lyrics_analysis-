It's all right
There comes a time
Got no patience
To search for peace of mind

Layin' low
Wanna take it slow
No more hiding
Or disguising truths I've sold

Everyday
Something hits me all so cold
Ya find me sittin' by myself
No excuses that I know

It's okay
Had a bad day
Hands are bruised from
Breakin' rocks all day

Drained and blue
I bleed for you
Ya think it's funny
Well you're drownin' in it too

Everyday
Something hits me all so cold
Find me sittin' by myself
No excuses that I know

Yeah, it's fine
Walk down the line
Leave our rain
A cold trade for warm sunshine

You my friend
I will defend
And if we change
Well I love you anyway

Everyday
Something hits me all so cold
Ya find me sittin' by myself
No excuses that I know
