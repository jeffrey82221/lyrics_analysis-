He said, "Angel put that purple skirt on, y'know it makes me hot"
He said, "Come on, Come on, get on, get up, look like
You're enjoying my company", oh and he said
You can't change a world
Your another one of my fools
You were born to have my baby now
Don't cry my precious one
Coz I ain't got no sympathy for you"
And I am, I feel, like
I wanna bite his head off
Yeah that'd be fun
Coz I sure got an appetite
I click my heels together three times
They sparked a little, but nothing happened
And the big bad wolf's still in my bed
I am, I feel
(I sometimes think that you forget) that
I am, I feel
I got to get away from here
I am, I feel
This girl's a person y'know
I am, I feel
Oh you said, "Angel your halo ain't fitted
that good for a little while now
You ain't got that certain glow that I get a kick out of"
(Like it bothered me)
I'm taking it on the chin, with a grin
But my feet are itchin' and itchin'
And he says, "Don't cry my precious one
Coz I ain't got no sympathy for you"
And I am, I feel, like
I wanna smash his face in
Yeah! That'd be fun
Coz I sure got a fist for a fight
I click my heels together three times
They sparked a little, but nothing happened
And the big bad wolf's still in my bed
And I am, I feel
(I sometimes think that you forget) that
I am, I feel
I got to get away from here
I am, I feel
And this girl's a person y'know
I am, I feel
Well it's had to get through it when you're knockin' on wood
And I got to thinkin' I was worth more than he put on my boots
I got a soul if you get down to the roots
I am, I feel
(I sometimes think that you forget) that
I am, I feel
I got to get away from here
I am, I feel
And this girl's a person y'know
I am, I feel
I am,
And I feel
I am,
And I feel
I am, I feel
This girl's a person y'know
I am, I feel
I am, I feel
(I sometimes think that you forget) that
I am, I feel
I got to get away from here
I am, I feel
And this girl's a person y'know...
