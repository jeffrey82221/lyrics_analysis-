So you think you got it all worked out
You got your hotpants on
You got your arse right out, you
Think that you are something new and special
And me and my drab-dress, we won't do at all

I spent so long tryin' to fit the prototype
I kept slippin' in the heels and I never got it right
Oh, what's the use, what's the point?
You've got the wrong girl, oh

So keep doing what you're doing down there
'Cause I'll be flying higher
Waste your own time, I don't care
Anything you can do, I can do better

All you girls 
You look and flip your hair and wonder why I'm still here, well
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
But, baby, that's OK

All you girls 
When you look into the mirror tell me how do you appear, well
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
But that's OK

So you got your little groups and gangs
You got your VIP, your "member-only"-things
Your happy-clappys and your VC crew
And if you get in their way, they got 10 on you

And I don't wanna be in that game
Don't wanna follow the leader, no way
What's the use, what's the point?
You've got the wrong girl

So keep doing what you're doing down there
'Cause I'll be flying higher
Waste your own time, I don't care
Anything you can do, I can do better

All you girls 
You look and flip your hair and wonder why I'm still here, well
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
But, baby, that's OK

All you girls 
When you look into the mirror tell me how do you appear, well
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
You're superficial, I'm a misfit

So what we don't look the same?
So what we don't, so what we don't?
So what I don't play your game?
So what I don't, so what I don't?
So what if I don't?

All you girls 
You look and flip your hair and wonder why I'm still here, well
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
But, baby, that's OK

All you girls 
When you look into the mirror tell me how do you appear, well
You're superficial, I'm a misfit (I'm a misfit)
You're superficial, I'm a misfit

All you girls 
You look and flip your hair and wonder why I'm still here, well
You're superficial, I'm a misfit (Misfit)
But, baby, that's OK

All you girls 
When you look into the mirror tell me how do you appear, well
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
But that's OK
