I do it for the joy it brings
because I'm a joyful girl.
Because the world owes me nothing
and we owe each other the world.
I do it because it's the least I can do.
I do it because I learned it from you
and I do it just because I want to
Because I want to.

Everything I do is judged
And they mostly get it wrong
But oh well.
'Cause the bathroom mirror has not budged
and the woman who lives there can tell
the truth from the stuff that they say.
And, she looks me in the eye
and says "would you prefer the easy way?
No? Well, okay, then ...
Don't cry."

I wonder if everything I do
I do instead
of something I want to do more?
The question fills my head.
I know there's no grand plan here
this is just the way it goes.
When everything else seems unclear
I guess at least I know

I do it for the joy it brings
because I'm a joyful girl
because the world owes me nothing
and we owe each other the world
I do it because it's the least I can do
I do it because I learned it from you
and I do it just because I want to
because I want to
