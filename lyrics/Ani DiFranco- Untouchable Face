Think I'm going for a walk now. I feel a little unsteady.
Don't want nobody to follow me. . . 'cept maybe you.

I could make you happy you know if you weren't already.
I could do a lot of things. . .and I do.

To tell you the truth I prefer  the worst of you.
Too bad you had to have a better half.

She's not really my type, but I think you two are forever
And I hate to say it, but you're perfect together

So fuck you
And your untouchable face
fuck you
For existing in the first place

And who am I
That I should be vying for your touch
Said who am I
I bet you can't even tell me that much

Two-thirty in the morning and my gas tank will be empty soon
Neon sign on the horizon Rubbing elbows with the moon

It's A safe haven of sleepless Where the deep fryer's always on
radio is counting down the top twenty country songs

And out on the porch the fly strip is waving like a flag in the wind
You know I don't look forward to seeing you again

You'll look like a photograph of yourself taken from far far away
And I won't know what to do. And I won't know what to say

Except fuck you
And your untouchable face
fuck you
For existing in the first place

And who am I
That I should be vying for your touch
Said who am I
I bet you can't even tell me that much

I see you and I'm so perplexed. What was I thinking?
What will I think of next? Where can I hide?

In the back room there's a lamp that hangs over the pool table
And when the fan is on it sways, gently side to side

And there's a changing constellation of balls as we are playing
I see Orion and say nothing the only thing I can think of saying

Is fuck you
And your untouchable face
fuck you
For existing in the first place

who am I
That I should be vying for your touch
Said who am I
I bet you can't even tell me that much

Said who am I
I bet you can't even tell me that much
Said who am I
Somebody just tell me that much

Said who am I
Somebody just tell me that much
Said who am I
Somebody just tell me that much
Said who am I
Somebody, somebody just tell me that much. . .
