Stop making the eyes at me and I’ll stop making the eyes at you
And what it is that surprises me is that I don’t really want you to
Your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
But you’re an explosion (you’re dynamite)
Your name isn’t Rio but I don’t care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, with a bang-go!

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Don’t know if you’re looking for romance, or…
I don’t know what you’re looking for
Well, I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

I wish you’d stop ignoring me because it’s sending me to despair
Without a sound, yeah, you’re calling me and I don’t think it’s very fair
That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
But you’re an explosion (you’re dynamite)
Your name isn’t Rio but I don’t care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, with a bang-go!

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Don’t know if you’re looking for romance, or…
I don’t know what you’re looking for
Well, I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

Oh, there ain’t no love, no Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes and DJ sets and
Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

Well, I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Don’t know if you’re looking for romance, or…
I don’t know what you’re looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!
