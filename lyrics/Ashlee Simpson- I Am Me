What's she got that I don't have?
Does she fill those spaces that I left you?
When you wake up every night,
Does the scent of regret ever haunt you?

Put this under your skin,
Cause I am me and I won't change for anyone,
(But) me, and I won't change for anyone
Yeah, for anyone like you

Does the weight of consequence
Drag you down until it pulls you under?
And does she lend an eager hand to save you
From the future of being with her?
But, are you with her?

Put this under her skin,
Cause I am me and I won't change for anyone
(But) me and I won't change for anyone
Yeah, for anyone like you

Why would I, why would I change?
Why would I change?

Put this under your skin,
Cause I am me and I won't change for anyone
(But) me, and I won't change, I won't change!

What's she got that I don't have?
What's she got that I don't have?

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!!
