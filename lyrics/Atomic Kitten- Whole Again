Natasha:
If you see me walking down the street
Staring at the sky
And dragging my two feet
You just pass me by
It still makes me cry
But you can make me whole again

And If you see me with another man
Laughing and joking
Doing what I can
I won't put you down
'Cause I want you around
You can make me whole again

All:
Looking back on when we first met
I can not escape and I can not forget
Baby you're the one, you still turn me on
You can make me whole again

Liz:
Time is laying heavy on my heart
Seems I've got too much of it
Since we've been apart
My friends make me smile
If only for a while
You can make me whole again

All:
Looking back on when we first met
I can not escape and I can not forget
Baby you're the one, you still turn me on
You can make me whole again

Kerry:
For now I'll have to wait
But baby if you change your mind
Don't be too late
Cause I just can't go on
It's already been too long
But you could make me whole again

All:
Lookin' back on when we first met
I can not escape and I can not forget
Baby you're the one, you still turn me on
You can make me whole again
Lookin' back on when we first met
I can not escape and I can not forget
Baby you're the one, you still turn me on
You can make me whole again

Baby you're the one
You still turn me on
You can make me whole again
