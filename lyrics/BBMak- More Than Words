Saying 'I Love you' is not the words
I want to hear from you 
It's not that I want you not to say 
But if you only knew 
How easy it would be to show me how you feel 
More than words is all you have to do 
To make it real then you wouldn't have to say 
That you love me cause I'd already know 

What would you do if my heart was torn in two 
More than words to show you feel 
That your love for me is real 
What would you say if I took those words away 
Then you couldn't make things new 
Just by saying I love you 
La la la la la la la
More than words 
La la la la la 
Ooooooooohhhhh 
Now that I've tried to talk to you 
And make you understand all you have to do 
Is close your eyes and just reach out your hands 

And touch me hold me close 
Don't ever let me go 
More than words is all I ever needed you to show 
Then you wouldn't have to say 
That you love me 'cause I'd already know
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
More than words
