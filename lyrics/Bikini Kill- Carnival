This is a song about the seedy underbelly of the carnival
The part that only the kids know about
This is a song about 16-year-old girls giving carnies head
For free rides and hits of pot
I wanna go
I wanna go!
I wanna go!
I wanna go to the carnival
But I know that it costs 16 dollars now
I wanna go to the carnival
But I know that it costs 16 dollars now
Round, round, round...
I'll win that Motely Crue mirror
If it fuckin' kills me!
Gonna lose 20 dollars while there
See the girls with the feathered hair
Wearing plastic, not real leather
Boots that go up to there, yeah
Round, round, round...
It's by the Lacey Mall
That's where you'll find me, yeah
