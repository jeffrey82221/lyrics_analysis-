Betty's got the back of her dress all ripped out
Mama's got her face muffled 
Twist and shout
You're a liar
Liar liar you got your pants on fire
You profit from the lie
You prophet from the lie
You profit from the rape lie baby
Eat meat
Hate blacks
Beat your fuckin wife
It's all the same thing
Deny, you live your life in denial 
Stand my whole life on trial baby
Deny deny deny deny
All we are saying is give peace a chance
