One night me and the crew hit the road on a mission 
To slurp free brew and go fuzzy flounder fishin' 
Kayjees on the hi-fi and the keg was bottomless 
Until we brought Skip O'Pot2Mus 
And Daddy's gonna get some probably underage and dumb 
And everybody knows that the Daddy eats his young 
Lupus in the lavatory makin' a big stink 
Macin' up the toilet seat and poopin' in the sink
M.S.G.'s tanked up and wizzin' in a cup 
Waitin' for a sprinkle genie to come and drink it up 
'Cause I'm the One Bottle Willy with the Twelve Horse Ale 
After that I get silly like Soupy Sales 
Now it's midnight and I'm completely boofy blitzed 
A six of Schlitz and the Jew brew Manischewitz 
With my beer-tinted glasses I'm ready to biddy battle 
I'm Hungry Like The Wolf but I'll end up tendin' cattle 

'Cause you're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
And I'm pretty fuckin' drunk 

Here she comes a funky fried cutie 
Mr. Jimmy Pop Ali is gonna get some booty 
'Cause I'm Mr. McFeelie with a Speedy Delivery 
You'd think I was a ditch the way this chick was diggin' me 
But maybe I should check and see if this is where I wanna be 
Hey Lupus is she cute? Yeah for a Pygmy 
What do you know? You're probably goin' home alone 
And it wouldn't be the first time that I gave a dog a bone 
Plus beauty it's only skin deep 
It's in the eye of the beholder and my beholder's about to tweak 
I could tap that barrel in fact I know I can 
It's a ménage à trois you and me and Heineken 

'Cause you're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
And I'm pretty fuckin' drunk 

Regrets I've had a few 
First and foremost I'd like to mention you 
For the sake of conversation we'll call you the brand new heavy 
You're a mix between an Ugnaut and Eugene Levy 
You can call it big-boned I'd prefer to call it gut 
You're Buddha you're Shamu you're Jabba the fuckin' Hutt 
You had harpoon scars and your boobies were hairy 
I smelt tuna melt but I wasn't gonna worry 
It was 3:00 A.M. and I wasn't gettin' squat
So I rolled you up in flour and aimed it for the wet spot 
I was buttering rolls like a soup kitchen Christian 
Then it hit me somethin' bit me while my little rod was fishing 
I was deep sea fishin' I took a fat chance 
But how was I supposed to know that Jabberjaws lived in your pants? 
At that junction I came to realize 
That only Frank Perdue likes thighs that size 
Fatty fatty boom ba latty I gotta lament 
That you were not a girl you were an experiment 

'Cause you're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
And I'm pretty fuckin' drunk 

You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
And I'm pretty fuckin' drunk
