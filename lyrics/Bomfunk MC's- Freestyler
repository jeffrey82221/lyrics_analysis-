Freestyler... rock the microphone
Straight from the top of my dome
Freestyler... rock the microphone
Carry on with the freestyler

I gotz to hmm, to throw on
And go on, you know I gotz to flow on
Select us on ya radio, play us
Cause we're friendly for ozone
But that's not all so hold on
Tight, as I rock the mic right
Oh... excuse me, pardon
As I synchronize with the analyzed
Upcoming vibes the session
Let there be a lesson, question
You carry protection
Or will your heart go on
Like CÃ©line Dion, Karma Chameleon

Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone

Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone

Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone

Hit me
Hit me
Hit me

Styles, steelos, we bring many kilos
So you could pick yours, from the various
Ambitious, nutritious, delicious, delirious
Or vicious, just tell us
We deliver anything from acappella's to propellers
Suckers get jealous
But they're soft like marshmallows
You know they can't handle us
Like Debbie does Dallas
Yeah, we come scandalous so who the fuck
Is Alice, is she from Buckingham Palace?

Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone

Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone

Hit me, hit me
Hit me, hit me
Hit me, hit me
Hit me, hit me

Freestyler... rock the microphone
Straight from the top of my dome
Freestyler... rock the microphone
Carry on with the freestyler

Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone

Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone

Hit me, hit me
Hit me, hit me
Hit me, hit me
