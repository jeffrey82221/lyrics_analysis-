8 o'clock, Monday night and I'm waiting
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring
She wears a two-way, but I'm not quite sure what that means

And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
But she doesn't notice me

'Cause she's watching wrestling
Creaming over tough guys
Listening to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes

It's like a bad movie
She's looking through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screaming someone shoot me
As I fail miserably
Trying to get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want

She likes the Godsmack and I like Agent Orange
Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have

And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
She'll never notice me

'Cause she's watching wrestling
Creaming over tough guys
Listening to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes

She likes 'em with a mustache
Racetrack season pass
Drivin' in a Trans Am
Does a mullet make a man?

It's like a bad movie
She's looking through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screaming someone shoot me
As I fail miserably
Trying to get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want

There she goes again with fishnets on
And dreadlocks in her hair
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated
All I wanted was to see her naked

Now I'm watching wrestling
Trying to be a tough guy
Listening to rap metal
Turntables in my eyes
I can't grow a mustache
And I ain't got no season pass
All I got's a moped (moped, moped)

It's like a bad movie
She's looking through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screaming someone shoot me
As I fail miserably
Trying to get the girl all the bad guys want

'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want (There she goes again)
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want (There she goes again)
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
