She works at Hot Topic
His heart microscopic
She thinks that it's love
But to him it's sex

He listens to emo
But Fat Mike's his hero
His bank account's zero
What comes next

Same song, different chorus...

It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us from Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your sweatbands
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands for Punk Rock 101

She bought him a skateboard, a rail slide, his knee tore
He traded it for drums at the local pawn shop
She left him for staring
At girls and not caring
When she cried 'cause she thought Bon Jovi broke up

Same song, second chorus...

It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us from Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your sweatbands
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands for Punk Rock 101

Don't forget to delay
On the very last word

Seven years later
He works as a waiter 
She married a trucker and he's never there
The story never changes 
Just the names and faces
Like Tommy and Gina 
They're livin' on a prayer

Did you just say that?
I said...

It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us from Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your sweatbands
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands for Punk Rock 101

It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us from Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your sweatbands
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands for Punk Rock 101

It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us from Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your rock hands
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's shoplift some sweatpants for Punk Rock 101
