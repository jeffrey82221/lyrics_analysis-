[Monica]
Excuse me do I know you cause uhh, you know you look kinda familiar? 

[Brandy] 
Yeah, you do too but, umm, I just wanted to know do you know somebody named you, you know his name. 

[Monica] 
Oh, yeah definitely I know his name. 

[Brandy] 
I just wanted to let you know he's mine. 

[Monica] 
Huh..no no, he's mine. 

[Chorus 1]
You need to give it up. 
Had about enough. 
It's not hard to see, the boy is mine. 

[Brandy]
I think it's time we got this straight, let's sit and talk face to face. 
There is no way you could mistake a boy oh, man are you insane? 

[Monica]
See I know that you may be just a bit jealous of me. 
'Cause you're blind, If you can't see that his love is all in me. 

[Brandy]
See I try to hesitate, I didn't want to say what he told me. 
He said without me he couldn't make through the day, ain't that a shame. 

[Monica] 
And maybe your misunderstood, plus I can't see, how he could want to take time and that's all good. 
All of my love was all it took. 

[Chorus 2]
You need to give it up. 
Had about enough. 
It's not hard to see, the boy is mine. 
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused. 
He belongs to me. 
The boy is mine. 

[Monica]
Must you do the things you do. 
Keep on acting like a fool. 
You need to know it's me not you well. 
If you didn't know it girl, it's true. 

[Brandy]
I think that you should realize. 
I'm trying to understand why. 
He is a part of my life. 
I know it's killing you inside. 

[Monica] 
You can say what, you want to say. 
What we have you can't take. 
From the truth you can't escape. 
I can tell the real from the fake. 

[Brandy] 
When will you get the picture. 
Your the past and not future. 
Get away it's my time to shine. 
If you didn't know the boy is mine. 

[Chorus 2]
You need to give it up. 
Had about enough. 
It's not hard to see, the boy is mine. 
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused. 
He belongs to me the boy is mine. 

[Monica] 
If you focus where I'm from. 
Simply gave the moon new round. 
The boy is above without a doubt. 
He might as well come in up top. 

[Brandy] 
What makes you think that he wants you. 
When I'm the one that brought him to special places in my heart. 
It was my lovin' from the start. 

[Chorus 2]
You need to give it up. 
Had about enough. 
It's not hard to see, the boy is mine. 
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused. 
He belongs to me the boy is mine. 

[Monica] - Not yours!!!!!! 
[Brandy] - But mine!!!!!! 
[Monica] - Not yours!!!!!! 
[Brandy] - But mine!!!!!! 
[Monica] - Not yours!!!!!! 
[Brandy] - But mine!!!!!! 

[Chorus 2]
You need to give it up. 
Had about enough. 
It's not hard to see, the boy is mine. 
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused. 
He belongs to me the boy is mine.
