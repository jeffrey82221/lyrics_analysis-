Brandy all over the world all over the world

Brandy on top of the world
Dark child on top of the world
Mase be on top of the world
Harlem World be on top of the world

Brandy on top of the world
Dark child be top of the world

I went from Helly Hanson to mini-mansions
The girls in Aruba doing belly-dancings
Spent half of my advancing jaws from Branson
I make it through my circumstances

But you know I'm wiser now move like kaiser now
Gotta butter soft cover just to hide my pound
Gotta house in the valley come and find me now
Got enough dough to buy the town

So, I might give a 6 to my chick, Benz to my mom
Crib so big it look like the Sinigon
Give a couch just to spill Henny on
And Benadon since Lados and Benaton

Some people say that I'm not the same girl
They say that I think I'm in my own world
What makes them think that I have changed
A little dough cannot erase my problems
Me like you I have to try and solve them
Yes, everything is quite the same

I'm just trying to be me doing what I got to do
Some people think that I'm just sittin' on top of the world
I'm just try to be me proving what I got to prove
Some people think that I'm just sittin' on top of the world

I wonder why it's often said that my life's a fairy tale and
Everything is so right I wish that you could know the truth
My life is real so please don't get it twisted
Problems the same and got to be dealt with
These are the things I wish you knew

Always in someone's eye so many questions why
How is it to be down with me with me
Afraid to express myself always me and someone else
I need to be free but its not that easy

I'm just trying to be me doing what I got to do
Some people think that I'm just sittin' on top of the world
I'm just try to be me proving what I got to prove
Some people think that I'm just sittin' on top of the world

Don't understand why people think I don't have friends
Who knew me bad when
This was my dream nothing has changed
I still do the same things

Yo, you can quit cookin' short if it ain't cookin' about cake
I ain't sittin' on top I want a house on a lake
I'm that snotty nosed cat with a new BM
If you mess with Brandy I gotta bruise your chin

I be with Puff the girls be like, "Who's his friend?"
If I hit a chick once you probably move me in
So you gotta tell me right now either your wit
The cats that make the hits or the ones that see the chips
(Slow down Mase you're killin' me)

But don't stop it
What's the use of buying a weight if I'm a have to chop it
I use the let a lady till I learned the logics
She only mess with Mase know the money ain't an object

If it ain't crissy he won't pop it
If it ain't platinum with ice he won't rock it
If it don't cost 60 he don't drop it
If it don't come with TVs he won't cop it
You can stop it , yeah yeah yeah, what what what?

I'm just trying to be me doing what I got to do
Some people think that I'm just sittin' on top of the world
I'm just try to be me proving what I got to prove
Some people think that I'm just sittin' on top of the world

Brandy on top of the world
Dark child on top of the world
Mase be on top of the world
Harlem World be on top of the world

Brandy on top of the world
Dark child be top of the world
M-A-dollar sign-E all over the world
Brandy all over the world
All over the world, all over the world
