How could she ever fool around
Don't know what she was thinking 'bout
While you were giving love
She let you down
Boy i know that you want to be alone
Cause she broke your heart
And she sent you home
And you were wondering why
She was  cold

Well when they lie
They have to lie again
Cause the lying never ends
So'

Truthfully
Even if you don't believe
You will always hear the truth
Come from me
(Baby) I'll never lie
And you're the reason why
I will always tell the truth
Cause the truth resides in me

Boy I know it's a crying shame
Baby no, no you shouldn't blame
Yourself for what she did
She was insane
Maybe where you go I will go
Whatever makes you happy
Let me know
My heart will be right here
To console you
Maybe the lies will never begin
I will be your lover, your best friend
So'Truthfully
Even if you don't believe
You will always hear the truth
Come from me
(Baby) I'll never lie
And you're the reason why
I will always tell the truth
Cause the truth resides in me

I will never say goodbye
And I don't want to see you cry
God only knows I love you
But its written in my eyes
You are the only one for me
There's no way I could ever leave
I would never, no never, never Lie to you
Truthfully

Truthfully
Even if you don't believe
You will always hear the truth
Come from me
(Baby) I'll never lie
And you're the reason why
I will always tell the truth
Cause the truth resides in me
