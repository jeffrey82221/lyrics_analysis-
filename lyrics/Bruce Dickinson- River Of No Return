River of No Return


Break the bread and drink the wine
Seize the chalice, suck the poison vine
There is frost in every sunbeam
Water flows from the earth to sky
Looking down on every rose
Nothing moves, the wheel of heaven turns
As our fingers leave their trace
We are gods in a world we dared embrace

[chorus:]
Now we're lost, you can’t disguise, the river of no return
Now it's time you realize, the river of no return

Glowing embers of our ancient lives
We struggle hard, we live to turn the tide
Living longer in the astral waste
We stare each other, we look death in the face
All my life, in front of you
Lonely secrets hidden from your view
Now we orbit a different sun
For eternity, doomed to tell no one

[chorus:]
Now we're lost, you can’t disguise, the river of no return
Now it's time you realize, the river of no return

[solo]

Now I'm truly all alone
Canyon walls and the river of no return
I'm amazed at what I am
I never knew the feelings I ignored

[extended chorus:]
Now we're lost, you can’t disguise, the river of no return
Now it's time we realize, the river of no return
And the anguish drives me on, I wish I could return
All the love that washed away
Down the river of no return
