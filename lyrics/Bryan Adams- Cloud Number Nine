Clue number one was when you knocked on my door.
Clue number two was the look that you wore.
And that's when i knew, it was a pretty good sign,
That something was wrong up on cloud number nine

Well it's along way up and we won't come down tonight
Well it may be wrong but baby it sure feels right

And the moon is out and the stars are bright
And whatever comes s'gonna be alright
'Cause tonight you will be mine - up on cloud number nine
And there ain't no place that I'd rather be
And we can't go back but you're here with me
Yeah, the weather is really fine - up on cloud number nine

Now he hurt you, and you hurt me
And that wasn't the way it was supposed to be
So, baby tonight let's leave the world behind
And spend some time up on cloud number nine

Well it's along way up and we won't come down tonight
Well it may be wrong but baby it sure feels right

Well we won't come down tonight
Ya we won't come down tonight
No we won't come down tonight

And the moon is out and the stars are bright
And whatever comes s'gonna be alright
'Cause tonight you will be mine - up on cloud number nine
And there ain't no place that I'd rather be
And we can't go back but you're here with me
Yeah, the weather is really fine - up on cloud number nine

We can watch the world go by - up on cloud number nine...
