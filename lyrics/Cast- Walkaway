If you've heard all they got to say
You looked but turned away
Walkaway, walkaway
If you've said all you got to say
And now the words just slip away
Just walkaway, walkaway, walkaway
That's what they say, what they say, what they say
You gotta walkaway

If you've played all the games they play
You played them yesterday
Walkaway, walkaway
If you've been, where they want to go
Seen all they got to show
Just walkaway, walkaway, walkaway
That's what they say, what they say, what they say
You gotta walkaway

And now you must believe me
You never lose your dreams
And now you must believe me
We never lose our dreams

If you've proved all there is to prove
Got nothing left to use
Walkaway, walkaway
If you've done, all there is to do
There ain't nothing left for you
Just walkaway, walkaway, walkaway
That's what they say, what they say, what they say
Walkaway, walkaway,walkaway
That's what they say, what they say, what they say
You gotta walkaway
