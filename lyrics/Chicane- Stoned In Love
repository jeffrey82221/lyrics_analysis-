If you could see me here this way
Looking backwards from today
Would you do it all again?
If I could roll it back to you
Just like lovers always do
I'm stoned in love but not with you

Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love
It's how I'm feeling now
I feel the love is made of stone
We're not feeling stoned in love

Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love
It's how I'm feeling now
I feel the love is made of stone
We're not feeling stoned in love

If we could wash the past away
Would we go our separate ways
I'd do it all again, as if I cared

Is this the way it's meant to be
Stoned in love but not with me
You're stoned in love but not with me

Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love
It's how I'm feeling now
I feel the love is made of stone
We're not feeling stoned in love

Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love
It's how I'm feeling now
I feel the love is made of stone
We're not feeling stoned in love

Stoned in love

I'm stoned in love but not with you

Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love
It's how I'm feeling now
I feel the love is made of stone
We're not feeling stoned in love

Stoned in love, stoned in love
Stoned in love, stoned in love
Stoned in love, stoned in love
Stoned in love but not with you

As if I care
If I care
