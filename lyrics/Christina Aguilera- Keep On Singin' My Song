I woke up this morning with a smile on my face
And nobody's gonna bring me down today
Been feeling like nothing's been going my way lately
But I decided right here and now
That my outlook's gonna change
That's why I'm gonna
Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried
Everytime somebody hurt my pride
Feelin' like they won't let me live life and
Take the time to look at what is mine

I see every blessing so clearly
And I thank God for what I got from above

I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me
They can say all they wanna say about me
But I'm gonna carry on (Carry on)
I'mma keep on (keep on) singin' my song

I never wanna dwell on the pain again
There's no use in relivin' how I hurt back then
Rememberin' too well the hell I felt 
When I was runnin' out of faith
Every step I'm 'bout to take 
Moves towards a better day

'cause I'm about to
Say farewell to every single lie
And all the fears I've held too long inside
Everytime I felt I couldn't try
All the negativity inside

For too long, I've been strugglin', couldn't go on
But now I've found I'm feelin' strong and I'm moving on

I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me
They can say all they wanna say about me
But I'm gonna carry on, (carry on)
I'mma keep on (keep on) singin' my song

Every time I tried to be what they wanted from me
It never came naturally, so I ended up in misery
Was unable to see all the good around me
Wasted so much energy on what they thought of me
Than simply just remembering to breathe
I'm humanly unable to please everyone at the same time
So now I find my peace of mind living one day at a time

In the end I answer to one god
Comes down to one love till I get to heaven above

I have made the decision 
Never to give in
Till the I day I die no matter what
Im gonna carry on, I'mma keep on singin' my song
(They can't take anything from me)

Repeat Chorus x2
