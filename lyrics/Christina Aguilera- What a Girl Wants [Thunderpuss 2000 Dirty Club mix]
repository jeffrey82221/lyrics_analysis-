I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe
Like a rock you waited so patiently
While I got it together, while I figured it out
I only looked but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holdin' hands, makin' plans and it's lucky for me you understand

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for doin' exactly

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for being there for me, yeah, yeah

A weaker man might have walked away but you had faith
Strong enough to move over and give me space
While I got it together, while I figured it out
They say if you love something let it go, if it comes back it's yours
That's how you know it's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure
And you're ready and willin' to give me more than

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for being there for me, yeah, yeah

A girl needs somebody sensitive but tough
Somebody there when the goin' gets rough
Every night he'll be giving his love to just one girl
Somebody cool but real tender too
Somebody, baby, just like you
Can keep me hangin' around with the one who always knew

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for doin' exactly

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for being there for me, yeah, yeah
