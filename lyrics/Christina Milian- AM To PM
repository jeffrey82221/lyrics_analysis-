So we can rock it day and night
People getting' down, that's right
From AM to PM (AM to PM)

Everybody lookin' like stars (Like stars)
All the chicks and the fellas in the bars (In the bars)
All of y'all bumpin' this in your cars (In your cars)
From AM to PM

Bloodshy (Yeah)

Now everybody wanna get down when you hear
The sound and you bump the beat
365 days a year
24 a day, 7 days a week

Now when you're driving in your 4 by 4
And you turn this up on your stereo
Whether night or day, non-stop you'll play
And you know you still want more

So find a honey that's standing on the wall
All the girls get the guys on the floor
From the front to the back let's go
Hear this (Oooh!)

Somebody hit the lights

Keep bobbin' your head now to this song
You got the beats and breaks and your body shake
And we're doin' it all night long

Any time or place, any place or time
No, we don't need no sleep
365 days a year
24 a day, 7 days a week

So find a honey that's standing on the wall
All the girls get the guys on the floor
From the front to the back let's go (Let's go)
Hear this (Oooh!)

Somebody hit the lights
So we can rock it day and night
People getting' down, that's right
