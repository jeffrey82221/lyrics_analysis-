(Burning Flesh, Dripping Sweat,
Unison, Like A Paralysed Snake,
Charmed And Enchanted By The Babalon Whore)

Led to the other worlds
By the girls she curled within
I took their skins to see her 
Be my, Be my mannequin

Be my mannequin

I cannot remember
How it was that we first met
Curve of the moon and haunted shore
The stars were not those heaven sent

Did we come together
At masked palatial balls
In silks and flesh and leather 
Or did we come at all?
I dreamt a midnight castle
The eerie song of wolves
And eyes that danced with fire
As they have forever more

Our rites of sin
Have long fathered a hymm
To burden him
Whom by slip of after-whim
At genesis 
Dressed her like the wind
In autumn gowns
That pinned her down
To be my, Be my mannequin

Be my mannequin

Always poised on winter
But never would she break
My lovecraft and black witch heart
That pounded in her wake

We kissed on distant balconies
A law unto her own
Thirteenth dark commandment
Of figures pressed to stone
Turning cream with fantasies
That god alone would know
We graced the vomitorium
With the sweet excess of Rome

Flagrant in the past 
Our names were deeply carved
On the tree of life in long dead
languages

Led to other worlds
By the girls she curled wihtin
I took their skins to see her
Be my, Be my mannequin

Be my mannequin

I tongued the nuns at Louviers
But not one word possessed
Her devine right, an archetype 
For mortal Goddess...
