CHORUS
I'm walking away, from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh to find a better day
(chorus X2)
I'm walking away

Sometimes some people get me wrong,
when it's something I've said or done
Sometimes you feel there is no fun,
that's why you turn and run
But now I truly realize,  
some people don't want to compromise
Well I saw them with my own eyes spreading those lies and
Well I don't want to live a lie, 
too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights, 
I'm sorry to say lady

CHORUS

Well I'm so tired baby
Things you say,
you're driving me away
Whispers in the powder room baby, 
don't listen to the games they play
Girl I thought you'd realize, 
I'm not like them other guys
Cuz I saw them with my own eyes,
you should have been more wise, and
I don't wanna live a lie,
too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights, 
I'm sorry to say lady

CHORUS(Repeat to end)
