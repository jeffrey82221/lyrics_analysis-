Dreamlands of danger
Darkside pleasures
Bad behavior
Dreamlands of danger
Darkside pleasures
At their best
(X2)

Punk rock, shell toes,
Horns and halos.
Wicked white wings and
And pointed tails.
Devil´s eyes and nine inch nails
Nocturnal renegades.
The eternal drug raid.
I go by the name of
Mr. Shifty switchblade.
Getting paid in the shade,
As lyrics ricochet,
Off the walls
From the ceiling to the floor,
Off the door
And down the hall.
I'm evil like Knievel
Kicking white trash.
Psycho cerebral, palsy, ballsy
Bad ass.
Dressed in black,
From the wrong side of the tracks.
Crazy Town.
Yo, we strike like deep impact.

CHORUS:
Why can't you see?
I cannot feel ´til you bring
Me down.

Dream lands of danger.
Darkside pleasures
Bad behavior.
Dream lands of danger.
Darkside pleasures
At their best.

My subconscience launches me
Into evil territory.
I'm surrounded by Voyeurs
And crack smoking lawyers.
No shame. Burnt lips,
Tripping on acid rain.
Legally insane, deranged,
Some people never change.

CHORUS

Nasty na na, ha, ha
Darkside marijuana.
Fueled of the drama.
Drifting on the darkside.
I'm the black eye bomber.
Do what I do on a darkside
Rendezvous.
Raising hell, out the shell.
Of fantasies I never tell.
Dispersin´ untamed perversion.
My bad brain´s working,
Circle jerking, rocking riddles,
Sex pistol, sexperts
Acting uncivil.

CHORUS
