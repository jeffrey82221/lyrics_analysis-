Everything is so complex,
Everyday is like a test, 
Full of obstacles that seem almost impossible, 
And I'm thinkin', just another breath,
Not a minute left, how long have i been drifting?

Pass the glass pipe, hit the flash light now break it,
People say I'm a star but I still think I'll never make it,
And I'm thinkin, just another prayer,
Not a second left, I feel there's something missing,

Chorus
Sometimes I hate that chaos surrounds me,
When all the answers that I see go around me,
Am I drowning, am I fading away,
Or am I livin' up to all your dreams that made me this way,
Am I drowning (x 4)

I've been to hell and back lookin' for the answers to life,
Lookin' at myself tryin to get things right,
And I'm feelin' just another breath, 
Not a minute left, I feel the darkness lifting

There was a time that I questioned if I'd ever be alright,
Runnin' gettin' high, stayin' trapped by sleepless nights,
And I'm thinkin', just another breath,
Not a minute left I feel there's something missing

I'm running from myself and all the things I don't like,
Livin' every night, like it's the last night,
And I'm thinkin', just another prayer,
Not a second left, I need to stop resisting

Chorus

Drowning in the drama, lost in the line,
Swept by the currents of life, caught in the rip tide. (x 4)
Am I drowning (x4)

Chorus 

Drowning in the drama, lost in the line,
Swept by the currents of life, caught in the rip tide. (x 2)
