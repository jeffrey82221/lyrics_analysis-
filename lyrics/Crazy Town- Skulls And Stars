I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky
I went from crawling around to being able to fly
Saw no future for me until i opened my eyes 
I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky

I tried love, heaven, hope and takin' chances
And all i got were broken dreams and failed romances
Suffered to a life of skin covered in scratches
Looking for the light but i could never find the passage
Tension, stress, pain yeah you best believe it 
Nose bleeding from my false way to relieve it 
Enough confusion to make serenity sick 
All my fake friends became my enemies quick 
Everyday i found another way to make excuses
Took the ropes i was supposed to climb and made nooses
Being stupid always giving in to the myth 
That life wasn't even worth living like this
A grown man trapped inside a young man's skin 
With resentment very very deep within
On a mission to end up either dead or in jail
No wonder everybody always said that i would fail

I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky
I went from crawling around to being able to fly
Saw no future for me until i opened my eyes 
I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky

I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky
I went from crawling around to being able to fly
Saw no future for me until i opened my eyes 
I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky

I found myself locked in a cell and i was just another number 
The thin ice was cracking and i was sinking under 
Often never felt but when i felt often was sorrow
Worried 'bout today dread would happen by tomorrow
Who knows the answers well nobody knows for certain
The evil things i did when i chose to close the curtain 
Perhaps i should relapse quit relapse quit 
Force it back and relax with a sack of good shit
Now i find myself in a candlelit depression 
Using sex like drugs just to handle my aggression

I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky
I went from crawling around to being able to fly
Saw no future for me until i opened my eyes 
I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky

I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky
I went from crawling around to being able to fly
Saw no future for me until i opened my eyes 
I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky

I had a little, had a lot, had it all and then i lost it
Stars are in my eyes and skeletons are in my closet 
Now when i open my eyes and i rise from the dead
Take control of my soul cause the lies are in my head
The right way is the left way and the left way is wrong 
So i'm left with the right way and the right way is long
So for once in my life i truly feel like i belong 
So i'll appreciate today and every day until i'm gone

I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky
I went from crawling around to being able to fly
Saw no future for me until i opened my eyes 
I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky

I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky
I went from crawling around to being able to fly
Saw no future for me until i opened my eyes 
I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky

I was a skull in the ground now i'm a star in the sky...
