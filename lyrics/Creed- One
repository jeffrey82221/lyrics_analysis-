Affirmative may be justified
Take from one, give to another
The goal is to be unified
Take my hand, be my brother

The payment silenced the masses
Sanctified by oppression
Unity took a back seat
Sliding further into regression

[Pre Chorus]
One, oh, One - The only way is One  (x2)

[Chorus]
I feel angry - I feel helpless
Want to change the world, yeah
I feel violent - I feel alone
Don't try to change my mind, no

Society blind by color
Why hold down one, to raise another?
Discrimination now on both sides
Seeds of hate blossom further

The world is heading for mutiny
When all we want is unity
We may rise and fall, but in the end,
We'll meet our fate together, oh

[Pre Chorus]  /  [Chorus x2]

Ohh, Oh yeah, (x2) ...[Chorus x2]
