Broken hearts 
Broken dreams 
There just somethings that love brings 
When you learn that it's all been a lie 
You cry 
You find that 

Nothing 
Nothing 
Nothing hurts like love 
Nothing brings your heart so much pain 
And you'll never learn

Till you get burned 
Till you're burned by the flame 
Nothing hurts so bad 
Nothing hurts so much 
No nothing hurts like love 

So you gave all you had 
How the story turned so sad 
Nothing left but the tears in your eyes 
You die inside 'cause

Nothing 
Nothing 
Nothing hurts like love 
Nothing brings your heart so much pain 
And you'll never learn

Till you get burned 
Till you're burned by the flame 
Nothing hurts so bad 
Nothing hurts so much 
No nothing hurts like love 

So dry your eyes 
It's just your turn to learn 
The time to find that nothing

Nothing
Nothing hurts like love 
Nothing brings your heart so much pain 
And you will never learn 

Till you get burned
Till you're burned by the flame 
Nothing hurts so bad 
Nothing hurts so much 
No nothing hurts like love
