Put the needle on it x8
Take the bait, bite the line, I got the place, you got the time, 
I'm lickin my lips, did I make you blush?
I let you in, the sweat you're in, the temperature is risin',
So hot, I may wanna take my clothes off 

Come inside, you're drippin desire, let the music make you rise up.
Dirty hands is what I demand, let the music make you rise up.

Put the needle on it, I  tell you where I want it,
Come on and spin me on it, all my freak say.
Put the needle on it, I  tell you where I want it,
Come on and spin me on it, all my freak say.

I dare you now, to be bad, do you want the best you've ever had?
You look so tame boy, let me wild you up.
Keep the lights dark and low, I'll keep you up all night
Until you feel it vibrating through your bones.

Come inside, you're trapped inside, let the music make you rise up.
Dirty hands is what I demand, let the music make you rise up.

Chorus x 2

Put. 
Put.
All my freaks say.
Put.
Put.
put.
Dirty hands I demand
Chorus    put the needle on itx6
