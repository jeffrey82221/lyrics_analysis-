"it's over now" by deborah cox

tryna forget about
ordinary things
typical, predictable
baby i knew the end before we started
you got me feeling like i owe you something
cause you were there at times when i had nothing
but you threw it all away
with the shady things you do

baby please forgive me
for what i'm 'bout to say
and what i'm 'bout to do
i can't take no more
i know you aint been true
aint got no love for you

chorus:
you been cheating and tellin me lies
you been creeping while i'm sleeping at night
and you been chasing every girl in sight 
and you been messing 'round and now ya down
it's over now (repeat)

i ignore my intuition
and pass it off as a suspision
but you were just so bold
you kept putting it in my face
i can't deny i let you hurt me

but baby please forgive me
for what i'm 'bout to say
and what i'm ' bout to do
i can't take no more
i know you aint been true
aint got no love you

chorus

when you were down i helped to pick you up
(but you didn't appreciate the love)
instead you kept lookin for the one 
when all the while what you were searching for
was in front of your face
just forget it... you'll regret it
it's really over now
just turn around and walk me watch i'm gone
