(Verse 1)
The sun will always shine on you
You turn my ocean deepest blue
I'll never hide my thoughts from you
You're my deepest blue

(Verse 2)
If mother nature ever chose a name
I'm sure that she would choose the same
I'll never hide my thoughts from you
You're my deepest blue

(Chorus)
Am I dreamin now walkin on the moon
And I don't know how to reach you baby
Every time I try to move closer

Am I dreamin now walkin on the moon
And I don't know how to reach you baby
Every time I try to move closer

(Verse 3)
We've only got this time to prove
That together we can make it through
I'll never hide my dreams from you
You're my deepest blue

(Verse 4)
If temptation ever came my way
I know the words I'd always say
I'll never hide my love from you
You're my deepest blue

(Chorus x4)
Am I dreamin now walkin on the moon
And I don't know how to reach you baby
Every time I try to move closer

Am I dreamin now walkin on the moon
And I don't know how to reach you baby
Every time I try to move closer

Am I dreamin now walkin on the moon
And I don't know how to reach you baby
Every time I try to move closer

Am I dreamin now walkin on the moon
And I don't know how to reach you baby
Every time I try to move closer

Every time I try to move closer

Am I dreamin now
