Hey yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Ooh yeah

It's over and done
But the heartache lives on inside
And who is the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight?

(And where were you now?)
Now that I need you
(Tears on my pillow)
Wherever you go down
(I'll cry me a river)
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotions takin' me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me darling

Don't you know there's no
(Nobody left in this world to hold me tight)
Don't you know there's no
(Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight)
Goodnight, goodnight

I'm there at your side
A part of all the things you are
But you've got a part of someone else
You've gotta go find your shining star

(And where were you now)
Now that I need you?
(Tears on my pillow)
Wherever you go
(I'll cry me a river)
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotions taken me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me darling

Don't you know there's
(Nobody left in this world to hold me tight)
(Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight)
Goodnight

(And where were you now?)
Now that I need you, oh you
(Tears on my pillow )
Wherever you, you'll go
(I'll cry me a river)
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotions takin' me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me darling

Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight
