(A cappella)
Amazing gra-a-a-ace
How sweet the sound, so-o-ound
That saved a wretch like me (me, me)
I once was lo-o-ost lo-o-o-ost
But now (but now) I'm found
(What you say girl)
But now I'm found (They still can't feel you)

But now I'm found
Was blind but now I see 

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And that gra-a-ace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
Thee hour I first believed
Thank you Lordy!
