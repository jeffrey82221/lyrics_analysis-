Buddy you're a boy
Make a big noise playin' in the street
Gonna be a big man some day
You got blood on your face, ya big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place
(Singing)

We will, we will rock you (ha ha)
We will, we will rock you (C'mon)

Keep the beat up, why, I'm gonna turn your heat up
Gonna get you on the floor, gonna burn your feet up, ah
Rockin' you, like I've never rocked you before
Like the way I do, got your screaming for more 
We're causin' utter devastation 
When we step in to the place 
And better believe that you can see 
We're gonna rock and never stop 
And here we go again 
Hit you with the flow again 
Kick it up the second time around 
We'll bring it on again 
Shout it out 
We will, we will rock you (we're gonna rock, we're gonna rock ya baby!)
We will, we will rock you (we're gonna rock, we gonna rock, we gonna rock ya)
We will, we will rock you (we're gonna rock, we're gonna rock ya baby!)
We will, we will rock you (ha ha)

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Ah!
Buddy you're an old man, poor man pleading with your eyes
Gonna make you something some day
You got mud on your face, ya big disgrace
Somebody better put you back in your place
(Singing)

We will, we will rock you (we're gonna rock, we're gonna rock ya baby!)
We will, we will rock you (we're gonna rock, we gonna rock, we gonna rock ya)
We will, we will rock you (we're gonna rock, we're gonna rock ya baby!)
We will, we will rock you (ha ha)
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
