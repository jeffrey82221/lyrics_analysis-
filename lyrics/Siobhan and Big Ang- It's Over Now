Tryin' to forget bout it
Ordinary things tipercal predictable
Baby I knew the end before we started 
You got me feeling like I owed you something
Cause you were there when times when I had nothing 
But you threw all away
With the shaded things you do

Baby please forgive me for what I am 'bout to say 
And what I am 'bout to do can't take no more
You've been cheatin' an tell me lies

[Chorus]
You've been cheatin' an tell me lies
You've been creepin' while am sleepin' at night and you've been chasing every girl in sight
An you've been messin' around but now your down its over now(x2)

I ain't gonna burn intuition
And pass on this all suspicion
But you were just too cold me kept puttin' me in my place
Can't deny I let you hurt me

Baby please forgive me for what I am 'bout to say 
And what I am 'bout to do can't take no more
I know you ain't been true ain't got no love for you cause 

[Chorus]
