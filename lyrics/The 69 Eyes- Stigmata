See my moment rise
With a little Jesus Christ
Blood is life
Blood is the truth
Gimme a moment, moment of you
And for Maria too...
Stigmata - blood and gasoline
A thought of you and the fire between
See my moment to rise
With a little Jesus Christ
Blood is life
Blood is you
Gimme a moment, moment of the truth
And for Maria too...
Chorus
only thought of you and the fire between
