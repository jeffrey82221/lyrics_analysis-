these last few weeks
I've been confused
sometimes I wonder if
I'm better off alone.

you fall in love
then break your heart.
you fall in love again
its never ending.

I used to have this friend
who took his fiance
to see billy idol
a couple weeks before
their wedding day.
the chick got backstage
and left my friend outside.
next day she called
from a hotel
asking for a ride.

I guess I'm giving up on love (x3)
'cause it really kind of sucks

uninspired
and growing tired
why am I always
so attracted to drama?

so here I am
grown up at 23
will someone tell me
what it takes to be happy?

I play in my band
and write a lot of songs
about relationships
and how mine went wrong.
maybe I'll meet that special
girl along the way
then she'll break my heart
and leave me crying.

i guess im giving up on love (x2)
cuz it really kind of sucks

i guess im giving up on love
