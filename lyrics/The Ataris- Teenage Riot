3 years gone by and still everyone screws up our name
no matter what you do still some things never change
seen a lot of the world, met a lot of friends
got a lot of fond memories
there's nothing like playing a basement show
on a saturday night in pennsylvania.

start the show, here we go
jumping in the crowd
we've gotta tear this building down.

the cops show up as usual
to try and ruin our fun.
it's time to show 'em all
just how its done.

gonna have a teenage riot.
they'll never understand
what it's like to be a kid today.
gonna have a teenage riot.
let's blow 'em all away.

another night we'll be
staying in some crack hotel
and sneaking everyone in
through the bathroom window.

gonna blow up everything in sight
and get chased away into the night
by some crazy bastard with a
shotgun in his hand.

start the show, here we go
jumping in the crowd
we've gotta tear this building down.
the cops show up as usual
and try to ruin our fun.
its time to tell them all to fuck off!

Gonna have a teenage riot
they'll never understand
what its like to be a kid today
gonna have a teenage riot
its gonna start today
