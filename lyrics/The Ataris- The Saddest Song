Only two more days until your birthday
Yesterday was mine
You'll be turning five
I know what it's like
growing up without your father in your life

So I pretend I'm doing all I can
and hope someday you'll find it in your heart
to understand why I'm not around
and forgive me for not being in your life

I remember waiting for you to come
Remember waiting for you to call
Remember waiting there to find nothing at all

I remember waiting for you to come
Remember waiting for you to call
Remember waiting there to find nothing at all

Maybe someday you'll really get to know me
not just from letters read to you
I pray I get the chance to make it up to you
We've got a lot of catching up to do

So I pretend I'm doing all I can
and hope someday you'll find it in your heart
to understand why I'm not around
and forgive me for not being in your life

I remember waiting for you to come
Remember waiting for you to call
Remember waiting there to find nothing at all

I remember waiting for you to come
Remember waiting for you to call
Remember waiting there to find nothing at all
