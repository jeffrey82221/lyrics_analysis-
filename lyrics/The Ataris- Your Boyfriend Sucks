You're better off without him, don't call him...
He's breaking your heart.
He's hanging with your best friend and you're waiting there,
It's tearing you apart.

He lied to you a thousand times,
When I was there he kept you waiting.

And I'm still here waiting there
To catch you if you fall.
I don't know why I care so much
When I shouldn't care at all.

Finally got the nerve to tell you
How much you mean to me,
You said that I was your best friend,
A real sweet guy, but that's all I'd ever be.

And I'm still here waiting there
To catch you if you fall.
I don't know why I care so much
When I shouldn't care at all
