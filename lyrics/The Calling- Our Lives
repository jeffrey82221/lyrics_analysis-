Is there love tonight?
When everyone's dreaming
Of a better life

In this world
Divided by fear
We've gotta believe that
There's a reason we're here

Yeah, there's a reason we're here

Oh
Yeah

'Cause these are the days worth living
These are the years we're given
And these are the moments, these are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

See the truth all around
Ooooh, our faith can be broken
And our hands can be bound, oh

But open our hearts
And fill up the emptiness
With nothing to stop us
Is it not worth the risk?

Yeah, is it not worth the risk?
No
Yeah!

'Cause these are the days worth living
These are the years we're given
And these are the moments, these are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

Even if hope was shattered
I know it wouldn't matter
'Cause these are the moments, these are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

We can't go on
Thinking it's wrong to speak our minds
I've gotta let out what's inside

Is there love tonight?
When everyone's dreaming
Can we get it right?
Yeah, well, can we get it right?

'Cause these are the days worth living
These are the years we're given
And these are the moments, these are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

And even if hope was shattered
I know it wouldn't matter
'Cause these are the moments, these are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

Oh yeah
Let's make the best out of our lives
Oh yeaheah
Let's make the best out of our lives!
