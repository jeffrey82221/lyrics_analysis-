Oh, come crush me now
Don't leave
no one has won this war
this time

No, don't sleep tonight, I'm hurt 
and ready for fire
Don't leave me up alarmed 
and ready to die

Come on, it's war, come on
come on, come on, come on
come on, it's war, come on

Please, I'm almost done
don't retreat
I've loaded my gun
with blood, with...

Hear the dust roll over the floor
why must you sleep?
Come crush me now, I'm armed
and ready to die

Come on, it's war, come on
come on, come on, come on
come on, it's war, come on (come crush me now)
come on, fight me, come on
come on, it's war, come on

You look so peaceful when you sleep
Beautiful creep
It's such an easy way to choose
you lose

(It's getting late)

come on, it's war, come on (Come crush me now)
come on, come on, come on
come on, fight me, come on
come on, come on, come on
come on, it's war, come on (Come crush me now)
come on, come on, come on
come on, it's war, come on

You look so peaceful when you sleep
Beautiful creep
It's such an easy way to choose
you lose
