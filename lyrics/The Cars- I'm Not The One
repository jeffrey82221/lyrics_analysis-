I'm not the one 
That you'll be shootin' for 
I'm not the one 
Who's coming back for more 
(You know why) 
We've been through this so many a-times 
(You know why) 
It's never clear it's pantomime 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
'Cause you can't get on your feet 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
Still takin' all the heat 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
Never lettin' down 

I'm not the one 
Whose memory you still keepin' 
I'm not the one 
Who's talkin' in your sleep 
(You know why) 
I don't have to tell you twice 
(You know why) 
Knew you when you weren't so nice 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
'Cause you can't get on your feet 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
Still takin' all the heat 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
Never touchin' down 

I'm not the one 
That you'll be breakin' in 
And I'm not the one 
That you'll be takin' in 
(You know why) 
Tried and tried to crack the shell 
(You know why) 
When you fake it's hard to tell 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
'Cause you can't get on your feet 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
Still takin' all the heat 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
'Cause you can't get on your feet 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
Still takin' all the heat 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
(Round and round) 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
(Round and round and round and round) 
Goin' round and round 
(Round and round) 
('Cause you can't get on your feet) 
Goin' (round and round) 
(Still takin' all the heat) 
(Round and round) 
('Cause you can't get on your feet) 
(Round and round) 
(Still takin' all the heat) 
(Round and round) 
('Cause you can't get on your feet) 
(Round and round) 
(Still takin' all the heat)
